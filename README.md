My first readme
Navigating through the shell environment is an interesting but not an easy task for me as a beginner but I can say I have become accustomed to using it and it gives me joy and hope that I can succeed as a software engineer.
Git and Github are interesting tools to use as a programmer if you know how to navigate well. I am really thankful for this experience!!!

Thank You ALX!!!
